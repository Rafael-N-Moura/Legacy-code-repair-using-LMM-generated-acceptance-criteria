Okay, I need to modernize this Java code to version 17. Let's start by looking at each file and identifying what needs to be changed.

First, Java 17 features include using records, switch expressions, sealed classes, pattern matching, etc. But looking at the provided code, it's using older constructs like Vector and Enumeration, and there's some boxing of primitives. Also, the use of Double and Float constructors is deprecated, so those should be replaced with valueOf.

Let me check each file one by one.

Starting with DPoint.java. The class is straightforward. The main thing here is that there are no major issues, but maybe the constructor with DPoint could use 'this' to call another constructor. Wait, no, it's initializing fields directly. Also, in the getX() and getY() methods, they mention throwing an exception if not valid. Maybe in modern Java, they could use Objects.requireNonNull or some validation. But the current code just returns the value. Also, the toString method could be rewritten using String.format for better readability. But since the original code is simple, maybe it's fine. Also, the class is mutable, but maybe that's intentional. Not sure if records can be used here since the class has mutable state. Probably not. So DPoint might not need changes except for possible minor code style improvements.

Moving to Histogram.java. The main things here are the use of int arrays and some loops. The line 'Double nogrps= new Double ((high - low)/ step);' is using the deprecated Double constructor. Should replace that with Double.valueOf or just cast to int. Wait, (high - low)/step is a double, then converting to int. So actually, that line can be simplified by casting: int nogrps = (int) ((high - low)/step); Then occurences = new int[nogrps]; So replace that line. Also, the for loop uses 'i < occurences.length', which is okay. Also, in addOccurence, the while loop adjusting 'which' could be replaced with Math.min or something. But maybe not necessary. So the main fix here is removing the deprecated Double constructor.

PhasePlot.java: This class uses Enumeration in the loop. Java 5 introduced generics and enhanced for loops, so using Enumeration is outdated. The line 'for (Enumeration e = points.elements() ; e.hasMoreElements() ;)' can be replaced with a for-each loop. But since 'points' is a Vector, which is part of Java's legacy code, in SimplePlot, the points are stored in a Vector. So in Java 17, we can use the enhanced for loop by converting the Vector to a List or using an iterator. Wait, Vector is still in Java, but using it with generics would be better. But the original code doesn't use generics, so in SimplePlot.java, the Vector is declared as 'public Vector points;' which is raw. So in PhasePlot.java, when they do 'points.elements()', they get an Enumeration. But in modern Java, we can replace that with an iterator or just use a for-each loop. However, since the code is using Java 17, perhaps replacing Enumeration with a stream or enhanced loop. So in PhasePlot's plotGraph method, the line:

for (Enumeration e = points.elements() ; e.hasMoreElements() ;) {

DPoint op = (DPoint)e.nextElement() ;

...

}

Can be replaced with:

for (DPoint op : Collections.list(points.elements())) {

...

}

But Collections.list is available. Alternatively, change the Vector to a List type, but that's part of SimplePlot's code. Since the original code is using Vector, maybe in SimplePlot we can parameterize it as Vector<DPoint>, then in PhasePlot, we can iterate using a for-each loop. But in the current code, the Vector is raw. So in SimplePlot.java, the line 'public Vector points;' should be 'public Vector<DPoint> points;' Then, in PhasePlot.java, the loop can be:

for (DPoint op : points) { ... }

But wait, the original code in SimplePlot initializes points as 'points = new Vector();' which is raw. To use generics, we need to change that to 'new Vector<>();' and declare as Vector<DPoint> points; So in SimplePlot.java, changing Vector to use generics would help. Also, in PhasePlot.java, the code can then use an enhanced for loop instead of Enumeration.

Additionally, in PhasePlot's plotGraph method, there's a division (1/phase). If phase is 0.5, that's 2.0, but perhaps using a floating-point division. But in Java, 1/phase is okay since phase is a double. So that's fine.

Plot.java: The code uses 'new String(...)' which is unnecessary. Strings can be assigned directly. For example, 'botText = new String ("X axis");' can be 'botText = "X axis";' Similarly for leftText. Also, in setXlabel and setYlabel, they assign to botText and leftText. Those can be simplified. Also, in calcX and calcY methods, there are lines like 'Double ret = new Double(...);' which is deprecated. Instead, use 'Double.valueOf(...)' or just cast. For example:

public int calcX(double d) {

return (int) (leftRule + ((d - minx)/scaleX));

}

Similarly for calcY. So replace the deprecated Double constructor calls with direct casting. Also, in the drawRulers method, they create Float objects using new, which is deprecated. Replace with Float.valueOf or just cast. For example:

stF = new Float(maxy + (maxy%ystep));

becomes:

stF = (float)(maxy + (maxy % ystep));

But actually, since stF is a Float object, perhaps using Float.valueOf(...). However, in Java 17, autoboxing is available, so maybe just:

float stFValue = (float) (maxy + (maxy % ystep));

stF = stFValue;

Wait, in the code:

stF = new Float(maxy + (maxy%ystep));

highY =  stF.intValue();

But maxy is a double. So (maxy + (maxy % ystep)) is a double, then cast to float, then stored in Float. But this seems error-prone. Alternatively, perhaps calculate highY directly as an int. Let me see:

The original code:

stF = new Float(maxy + (maxy%ystep));

highY = stF.intValue();

But this is equivalent to:

highY = (int) (maxy + (maxy % ystep));

But since maxy is a double and ystep is an int (as per the variable declarations: ystep is int in Plot.java). Wait, no, looking at Plot's fields:

public int ystep=-1,numberStep=5,ynumberStep=5;

public double xstep=-1;

So ystep is an int. So (maxy % ystep) is valid. Then adding to maxy, then casting to int. So instead of creating a Float, just cast the result to int.

So replace:

stF = new Float(maxy + (maxy%ystep));

highY =  stF.intValue();

with:

highY = (int) (maxy + (maxy % ystep));

Similarly for other places where new Float or new Double is used.

In the setScales method:

scaleX = (maxx - minx) / gWidth;

scaleY = (maxy - miny) / gHeight;

But if gWidth or gHeight is zero, this could be a problem, but perhaps the code assumes that the component has a valid size.

In Plot.java's plotPoint method, there's a line:

Double offd = new Double(pointSize/2);

int off = offd.intValue();

But pointSize is an int, so pointSize/2 is integer division. If pointSize is 4, then offd is 2.0. So better to just compute off as pointSize/2.

So replace:

Double offd = new Double(pointSize/2);

int off = offd.intValue();

with:

int off = pointSize / 2;

But pointSize is declared as an int. So no need for Double here. The original code is doing unnecessary boxing.

In SimplePlot.java, the Vector is used without generics. So changing:

public Vector points;

to:

public Vector<DPoint> points;

And initializing with:

points = new Vector<>();

This would allow using enhanced for loops and avoid casting. Then, in PhasePlot.java's loop, instead of using Enumeration, it can iterate with:

for (DPoint op : points) { ... }

But in the current code, in PhasePlot's plotGraph method, they have:

for (Enumeration e = points.elements() ; e.hasMoreElements() ;) {

DPoint op = (DPoint)e.nextElement() ;

...

}

If points is a Vector<DPoint>, then points.elements() returns an Enumeration<DPoint>, so in Java 5+, we can use a for-each loop:

for (DPoint op : points) { ... }

So replacing the Enumeration loop with a for-each loop would be better.

Also, in SimplePlot's addPoint method, they check if points != null. But after init, points is initialized to a new Vector, so maybe the null check is unnecessary. But it's there for safety.

Other things to check:

- Use @Override annotations where methods override superclass methods.

- Replace Vector with ArrayList if possible, but Vector is synchronized, and maybe the original code relies on that. However, since the code uses AWT, which is not thread-safe, perhaps the synchronization isn't necessary. But since the user didn't mention changing data structures, maybe just parameterizing Vector is sufficient.

- Check for any deprecated methods or classes. For example, in Histogram.java's init method:

Double nogrps= new Double ((high - low)/ step);

occurences=new int[nogrps.intValue()];

This is using the deprecated Double constructor. Replace with:

int nogrps = (int) ((high - low)/ step);

occurences = new int[nogrps];

So removing the Double object creation entirely.

In Plot's drawRulers method:

stF = new Float(maxy + (maxy%ystep));

highY =  stF.intValue();

Replace with:

highY = (int) (maxy + (maxy % ystep));

Similarly for lowY, highX, lowX.

Another thing: in DPoint.java, the semiValidate method has a comment about throwing an exception if !valid. The getX and getY methods don't throw an exception. If they should, maybe add:

if (!valid) throw new IllegalStateException("DPoint is not valid");

But the original code doesn't do that. Since the user wants to modernize to Java 17, perhaps adding proper exception handling here. But that's a functional change, so unless the user specifies, it's better to leave as is. The user's instruction is to modernize the code to Java 17, not to fix logic errors.

Another thing: in Java 17, the strictfp keyword is less relevant, but the code doesn't use it, so no issue.

Also, in SimplePlot's plotZero method, the variables xi, x1, x2, etc., are calculated but xi is not used. That's a dead store. But maybe that's a leftover from previous code. Can remove xi.

In PhasePlot's constructor, xstep is set to 0.1, but in resetGraph, xstep is set to 0.5. But in the original code, resetGraph is called by super.resetGraph(), which in Plot's resetGraph does nothing except call plotGraph. Wait, looking at Plot's resetGraph: the code for resetGraph is only present in Histogram and SimplePlot. Wait, looking at the code:

In Plot.java, there is a resetGraph method? Let me check. No, Plot.java's code has a resetGraph in Histogram.java and SimplePlot.java. Wait, no: in Plot.java, there is no resetGraph method. The resetGraph method is in Histogram and SimplePlot. In PhasePlot.java, the resetGraph method overrides the one in SimplePlot, which in turn overrides the one in Plot? Wait, no. Wait, Plot is a Canvas, and the resetGraph is added in subclasses. So in PhasePlot's resetGraph, it calls super.resetGraph(), which is SimplePlot's resetGraph, which sets points to a new Vector. But the original code may have intended something else. However, since we're not changing functionality, just modernizing syntax, this isn't an issue.

So to summarize, the changes needed are:

1. Replace deprecated constructors for Double, Float with valueOf or direct casting.

2. Use generics for Vectors to avoid raw types and enable for-each loops.

3. Replace Enumeration with for-each loops where possible.

4. Remove unnecessary object creation (e.g., new Double, new Float).

5. Replace String instantiation with direct assignment.

6. Add @Override annotations to overridden methods.

7. Fix any remaining code style issues (e.g., unnecessary semicolons after method declarations, like in DPoint's isValid()).

Let's go through each file again with these points in mind.

File 1: DPoint.java

- The line 'public boolean isValid() { return valid; };' has an unnecessary semicolon. Remove it.

- The getX() and getY() methods could throw an exception if !valid, but the user hasn't asked for functional changes. Leave as is.

- The toString() method can use String.format for better formatting, but it's optional. Original code returns ""+x+"  "+y, which is acceptable.

File 2: Histogram.java

- Replace 'Double nogrps= new Double ((high - low)/ step);' with 'int nogrps = (int) ((high - low) / step);' and then 'occurences = new int[nogrps];'

- Also, 'occurences' is misspelled; should be 'occurrences', but unless the user wants to correct variable names, leave as is.

File 3: PhasePlot.java

- Change the Enumeration loop to a for-each loop. Since points in SimplePlot will be a Vector<DPoint>, in PhasePlot's plotGraph, it can iterate with for (DPoint op : points) { ... }, but need to check if 'points' is accessible. Wait, in SimplePlot, 'points' is declared as public, so PhasePlot can access it directly. However, using raw types would give warnings. So in SimplePlot, changing points to be Vector<DPoint> allows PhasePlot to use it with generics.

But wait, PhasePlot extends SimplePlot, which has 'public Vector points;'. So if SimplePlot changes 'points' to 'public Vector<DPoint> points;', then in PhasePlot, 'points' would be of that type. Thus, in PhasePlot's plotGraph method, the loop can be written as:

for (DPoint op : points) { ... }

Instead of using Enumeration. This would eliminate the casting and use of Enumeration.

File 4: Plot.java

- Replace 'new String(...)' with direct assignment.

- Replace deprecated Double and Float constructors with casting.

- In calcX and calcY, replace new Double(...) with direct casting.

- In drawRulers, replace the Float and Double object creations with direct casting to int.

- In plotPoint, remove the use of Double for 'offd' and compute directly as pointSize/2.

File 5: SimplePlot.java

- Change 'public Vector points;' to 'public Vector<DPoint> points;' and initialize with 'points = new Vector<>();'.

- In the addPoint method, the parameter is DPoint, so using generics is safe.

- In plotGraph, the loop can use for-each.

Other changes:

- Add @Override annotations to methods that override superclass methods. For example, in Histogram's plotGraph, add @Override. Similarly for other overridden methods like paint, resetGraph, etc.

- Check for any instances of 'new Double' or 'new Float' and replace them.

Now, let's implement these changes step by step for each file.

For DPoint.java:

- Remove semicolon after isValid() method.

- No other changes needed unless adding validation exceptions, but that's a functional change.

Histogram.java:

- Replace the Double nogrps line with int calculation.

- Add @Override to resetGraph and plotGraph methods.

PhasePlot.java:

- Replace Enumeration loop with for-each loop over points.

- Add @Override to plotGraph and setPhase/getPhase if applicable.

Plot.java:

- Replace new String with direct strings.

- Replace Double and Float constructors with casting.

- Change calcX and calcY to use casting instead of Double objects.

- In plotPoint, compute off as pointSize/2 directly.

- Add @Override annotations where needed (paint, plotGraph, etc.).

SimplePlot.java:

- Change Vector to Vector<DPoint>.

- Initialize points with new Vector<>().

- Change addPoint to use generics (though the parameter is already DPoint).

- In plotGraph, replace Enumeration loop with for-each.

- Add @Override annotations.

Other possible changes:

- Use List instead of Vector, but since the user didn't mention changing data structures, it's safer to keep Vector but parameterize it.

- In SimplePlot's resetGraph, points are initialized as new Vector(); should be new Vector<>().

Now, let's write out the updated files with these changes applied.

To modernize the provided code to Java 17, several updates are necessary, including using generics, replacing deprecated constructors, utilizing enhanced for-loops, and adding @Override annotations. Here's the revised code:
